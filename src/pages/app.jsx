              Josh began playing the trumpet when he was in third grade. He became skilled with the trumpet,
              continuing with his musical stylings through high school where he was first chair and regular
              soloist on the marching field. In college Josh studied music and picked up the guitar. He was
              primarily self-taught on the guitar, although he received help from his many musical relatives,
              especially his Uncle Mike. Josh went on to found several bands while living in central Florida.
              He recorded two cds and was played on the local radio stations. Josh also played in many
              venues including the Sun cruise casino ship and the Battle of the Bands. His career took a
              different turn when he moved to Virginia. Leaving his band behind, Josh played at the GE Pig
              roast several years and performed solo at Mill Mountain coffee shop and the 4th Street coffee
              shop. Josh started singing with Maria in the fall of 2011. They fell in love and were married
              in July of 2012. Vive lâ€™amore!

                Maria started her singing career at the age of 4 when she performed at the JaMar Rec
                Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Maria continued adding to her musical repertoire
                by learning piano, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, bassoon, and marching tenors.
                She earned a minor in voice at Roanoke College and did a variety of chorus, musical theatre,
                and solo performances while teaching in the Roanoke County Schools. Although classically
                trained, Maria loves singing rock and Christian music with Josh, and hopes to add bass
                guitar to her list of instruments soon. Josh is the most wonderful husband and is the driving
                force for the couple; Maria is a fabulous wife and is the organization behind the duo.
